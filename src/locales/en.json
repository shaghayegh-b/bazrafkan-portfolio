Over the past year, I’ve been deeply focused on learning and practicing web development, gaining solid experience with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, Sass, jQuery, Git, and GitHub.

Currently, I'm working on personal projects to further enhance my practical skills, with the goal of becoming a freelance web designer and gaining real-world experience.
